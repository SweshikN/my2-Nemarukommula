###### Goa

**India's tropical** paradise is Goa. The stunning Western Ghats of India, a large mountain range and a treasure trove of **biodiversity**, enclose around 20% of the territory of Goa. Indian giant squirrels, mongooses, slender lorises, Indian macaques, and sloth bears are just a few of the unique animals that may be found in these **jungles**.
